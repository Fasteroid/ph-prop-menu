# Prop Chooser
## An Automated Prop List, which you can choose whenever you want!

## About

Simple addons for Prop Hunt: Enhanced which allows you to choose any props from a map whenever you want!  
Current Version: **1.2**

Fixes on 1.2:
- Removed some uneeded net Messages
- Added delay to prevent Model-Changing Spam
- Limit can be checked both in client and server-side
- Added CVars
- Other Improvements

### How it Works

*Please note: currently this addon may only works & supported for Prop Hunt: Enhanced.*

Map Props will be scanned and added during gamemode initialisation. They will soon be added into a list (Proccessed in serverside) and transfered to client side.  
Each time when player joins, the prop list will be available to them.  
The Prop Chooser list window will only appear when you are on Prop Team by simply pressing F8 key by default.

By default, Prop team have 3x chances to choose and change the prop whenever they can. (It can be unlimited based settings!) - Make sure you have a some plenty-open room choose other props, 
and stay on the ground and not crouching as well.

### What Can't
- Assign random/custom prop from a player/client ( this will provided from Server only! )
- Add custom prop from player

This is perfect condition whenever you were feel attacked / found by selecting any props you like to change and... Taadaaa...! hunters will be confused ðŸ˜‰

*Please note: This addon is a Server-sided Feature. It's not meant to be available for client-side!*

### How's about Customisation and/or configurations?

#### Console Variable & Configurations

#### How to Add Custom Props & Adding Prop Bans?

Simply, navigate to your Root Garry's Mod game data folder, e.g: "../garrysmod/data/phe_config/" - You'll see two folder called:
- A folder "prop_chooser_custom" containing "models.txt", which will be used to add new Props Model; and
- A folder "prop_model_bans" containing "model_bans.txt" and "pcr_bans.txt" which will be used to add Prop Bans model.
- Make sure these files & folders are Writeable!

Each data will contains something like this:

```json
[
	"models/something.mdl",
	"models/anothermodels.mdl",
	"models/any/other/paths/here.mdl"
]
```

#### But, How do I get model listed after it being added?
Currently there is a console command to debug & list which models has been added to the Prop Chooser list: "pcr_debug_model_list".  
This command will prints All available models listed which specified from the maps, and can be accessed only by Admin/Superadmin.
